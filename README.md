# Arduino Temperature Monitor
Used a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor to transmit data to an Arduino Uno, which displays real time visualization of temperature and humidity on an OLED display.

# Key Features
 - Displays a real time line graph to depict humidity trends, dynamically updating.
 - Created a gradient for thermometer visualization based on current temperature using color masking and bit shifting.
 - Only refreshes parts of display when a visual change should occur.
